## Other, Closely related Fractals

The Sierpinski Carpet actually is a two-dimensional version of two very, very famous Fractals:

### The Cantor Set

Did you know: The [Cantor Set](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/CantorSet) is a One-Dimensional version of the Sierpinski Carpet!

It looks loke this:
