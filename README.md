The Sierpinski Carpet is a two dimensional version of two other, very famous Fractals (more below).

## Other, Closely related Fractals

The Sierpinski Carpet actually is a two-dimensional version of two other very, very famous Fractals:

### The Cantor Set

If you think about ut, the Sierpinski Carpet consists of a bunch of squares, really.

And a square is two-dimensional. It has a width and a height.

Did you know that the [Cantor Set](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/CantorSet) is a One-Dimensional version of the Sierpinski Carpet?

It looks loke this:

You can find out more about the Cantor Set [here](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/CantorSet)

But wait! It gets even better!

### The Menger Sponge

Check out this thing:

It's called a [Menger Sponge](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/MengerSponge)!

And - you guessed it - it's a three-dimensional version of the Sierpinski Carpet!

You can find my version of the Menger Sponge [right here](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/MengerSponge)!
